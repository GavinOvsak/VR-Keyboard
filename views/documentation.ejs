Intro
vOS apps can easily create immersive remote controlled experiences in a few lines.
vOS apps are written using THREE.js and are just javascript files hosted on your own server which define methods for vOS to run to display your app. Using the vOS API, you can easily make a dynamic control panel to receive input from your users.
